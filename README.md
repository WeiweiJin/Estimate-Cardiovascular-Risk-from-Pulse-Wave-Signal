These are the Python code I used in the project to estimate pulse wave velocity, a risk factor of cardiovsacular disease, using radial pressure wave, a prepherial pulse wave signal. These tools can be modified and applied to estimate other risk factors for diseases or any other subject of interests using pulse wave signals.
